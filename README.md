Realizing that an organization’s CMMI level impacts an organization’s success on requests for proposals (RFPs), your CIO wants to get the software development processes to CMMI level 3. Your organization has started developing software applications and database systems for their customers. The CIO wants to ensure that the software development and database development processes are being properly managed and audited, and he wants to ensure that the organization begins taking the necessary steps to progress to CMMI level 3. In preparation for your response, review the CMMI information available at the Carnegie Mellon Website, located at <a href="https://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/</a>.
